I'm Abhishek Sankar, currently pursuing my MS in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).
I previously worked a software engineer at [Providence](https://www.linkedin.com/company/providence-india/), where I got to work on interesting problems in healthcare.

I'm passionate about building products that solve real-world problems. Small ones and the not so small ones. I've been a part of a few hackathons and have won a few of them.

I'm currently working on Sebastian Raschka's book [Build a Large Language Model](https://www.amazon.com/Build-Large-Language-Model-Scratch/dp/1633437167), where I'm learning about the internals of GPT-2 and GPT-3. I'm also working on a few side projects that I hope to share soon.

Something really cool that I'm working on is a an app to make the internet more accessible, leveraging the computer use api by anthropic, along with the gpt-4o voice model. I think these leaps will go a long way toward enabling more and more people to access and interact with more of the internet. Hit me up if you'd be interested in something like this!

I keep an [open list](https://abhisheksankar.com/reading-list.md) of what I read (well, at least after the pandemic began). If you have recommendations, shoot me a DM :\)
