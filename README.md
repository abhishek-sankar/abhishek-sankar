I'm Abhishek Sankar, currently pursuing my MS in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://msaii.cs.cmu.edu/directory/students/current/s).
I previously worked as an Applied AI engineer at [Bank of new York](https://www.bny.com), where I got to work on coding agents.

I'm passionate about building products that solve real-world problems. Small ones and the not so small ones. I've been a part of a few hackathons and have won a few of them.


I keep an [open list](https://abhisheksankar.com/reading) of what I read (well, at least after the pandemic began). If you have recommendations, shoot me a DM :\)
