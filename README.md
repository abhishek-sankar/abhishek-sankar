I'm Abhishek Sankar, currently pursuing my MS in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://msaii.cs.cmu.edu/directory/students/current/s).
I previously worked a software engineer at [Providence Health](https://www.linkedin.com/company/providence-india/), where I got to work on behavioural health and async care problems.

I'm passionate about building products that solve real-world problems. Small ones and the not so small ones. I've been a part of a few hackathons and have won a few of them.

I'm currently working on Sebastian Raschka's book [Build a Large Language Model](https://www.amazon.com/Build-Large-Language-Model-Scratch/dp/1633437167), where I'm learning about the internals of LLMs. I'm also working on a few side projects that I hope to share soon.

I keep an [open list](https://abhisheksankar.com/reading) of what I read (well, at least after the pandemic began). If you have recommendations, shoot me a DM :\)
